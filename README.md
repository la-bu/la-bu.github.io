# Personal Website & Blog

This project is my personal website and blog where I share insights on tech, music production, AI, and programming. It's built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a flexible static site generator, managed using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and enhanced with [nanchacks](https://github.com/nanchacks) for additional customization and efficiency.

The purpose of this site is twofold: to showcase my work as a fullstack developer with a creative edge, and to serve as a space where I explore topics that inspire me. Whether you're here as a potential employer or simply a curious visitor, I hope you enjoy exploring what I've been up to.
