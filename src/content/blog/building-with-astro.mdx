# Building with Astro

Astro's Islands Architecture is a perfect fit for a content-focused site like this one. Pages ship zero JavaScript by default, and interactive components only hydrate when needed.

## What I Like

- **Content collections** make managing blog posts simple with built-in schema validation.
- **MDX support** lets me embed components directly in my writing.
- **File-based routing** keeps the project structure intuitive.

## What's Next

I'm planning to add an RSS feed, dark mode theming, and a portfolio section. More on that soon.
